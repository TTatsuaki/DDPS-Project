#INTRODUCTION
When in May 2021 there was yet another war-like outburst in the long history of the Israel-Palestine conflict it did not take long until thorough Western (?) media coverage took of. However, with increasing media attention there was also rising criticism of the manner of coverage - especially the choice of words when describing the conflict. This criticism, largely voiced on social media and later institutionalised through various non-western aligned news outlets consistently remarked the choice of using ‘neutral’ terms when covering the conflict (such as ‘clash’, ‘property dispute’) as well as a skewed attention to palestinian aggressors (‘terrorists’) over Israeli violence (‘police operation’). This increasingly voiced contradicting narrative quickly became a substantive part of the online discourse on the topic, contradicting the dominant perspective on the events. 
This research analyses the effects of the public sphere’s assessment of the media coverage through text analysis. To do so, it will first refresh the reader’s memory of the timeline of May 2021, before briefly introducing the theory of framing. Then, the paper will depict the widely spread criticism of Western media framing the new escalation of conflict in Israel Palestine, before quickly diving into the idea of public spheres and the influence of alternative media on mainstream discourse. 
Having laid the ground for the actual research, the paper will adress the

#TIMELINE OF THE CONFLICT

The newest hot period of the now 70 years long Israel-Palestine conflict built up in April and early May 2021 due to the planned eviction of Palestinian families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighbourhood, a part of East Jerusalem with a history of conflict since the 50s between the residing Palestinian population and Israelian settlers (El-Haroun, 2021). At the beginning of May, a series of escalations between Palestinian (violent) demonstrators and Israelian armed forces took place, resulting in several dead. The conflict intensified over the end of Ramadan, the holy month for Muslims, when the Israelian military and police surrounded the Al-Aqsa mosque on May 7th, provoking violent demonstrations on the side of Palestinians answered by the use of water cannons and stun grenades (Farrell, S.; Lubell, M., 2021). The conflict escalated into a military conflict on May 10th when Israeli police stormed a building of Palestinian worshippers, planning to raid it. This raid, coinciding with the yearly celebration of the Israeli occupation of Jerusalem led to Hamas firing rockets at Israeli territory, provoking airstrikes from the Israeli side to Gaza (the Guardian, 2021). With protests in Muslim dominated cities, Israel declared an emergency state over these cities, leading to an intensification of violence and continued bombing of Palestinian territory, as well as counter bombing aimed at Israeli territory. The bombing continued, with Israel destroying a residential tower in Gaza on May 11th, claiming Hamas had used this building for planning attacks, answered by over 100 missiles sent by the Hamas to Israel (Reuters, 2021). The sending of missiles, arrests of Palestinians and raids on Israeli territory as well as intense violence continued until May 20th when a ceasefire was negotiated (Tal, A., 2021). Although this agreement does not lead to the suspension of violence overall, it stops the sending of heavy attilery on both sides. 

#NEUTRAL ON THE OUTSIDE; BIASSED ON THE INSIDE? SUMMARISING CRITICISM OF WESTERN MEDIA COVERAGE OF THE MAY 2021 ISRAEL-PALESTINE CONFLICT AND ITS POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON PUBLIC DISCOURSE

This research paper will critically examine the media coverage of the conflict. For this, the paper will first briefly introduce the reader to the idea of framing in media, then look into widespread criticism of Western media coverage, before diving into the discussion of public spheres and their influence on mainstream media outlets. 

##Framing as an integral aspect of text

Framing is a body of theory widely used in media studies generally and journalism specifically, referring to the way of projecting certain events in a certain manner, usually, through using images, words or contexts: “to frame is to select some aspects of a perceived reality and make them more salient in a communicating text, in such a way as to propose a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation for the item described” (emphasis not added, Entman, 52). Framing, therefore, happens with the goal to portray a given issue in a certain light, but it does not mean that facts are necessarily changed, it rather concerns the vocabulary that is used to express a certain situation. It is important to note that writing a text without using frames is not possible, as the portrayed issue in the text is always represented in some way. Also, neutral, objective scientific terms are putting a described issue into a certain perspective. Framing, therefore, does not have to be intentionally manipulative, it is rather very much the way the issue at stake is expressed. It would go beyond this research to go into a full literature review on academic theories of framing, therefore the paper will exclusively look at how theory applies to the present case. 

##Criticism of Western ‘neutral’ frames 

When tensions rose and the conflict started escalating into a new hot phase, Western media did not take long to pick up on the conflict and elaborately report on it. 

* here we could insert a graph showing the increase in the coverage of the issue during the time of the hot phase (which could also justify our selection for the time frame) (julia)

Starting first of May, English language media outlets started publishing extensively on the issue, bringing the conflict once again into the centre of media attention and public discourse. The manner of media coverage, however, was soon criticised as depicting reality in a distorted way, backing up the Israeli perspective and leading to anti-Palestinian sentiments. The deliberate use of “objective” terms in Western media coverage was criticised as favouring and supporting the Israeli narrative against the Palestinian reality. What was first criticised by social media users, was soon picked up by The problem with neutral terms is that it assumes equality between the ‘conflict groups’ and a sense of mutuality in the conflict (O'Toole, M., 2021). Specifically words such as ‘clashes’, or ‘property/territory dispute’ imply that there is “a degree of equality in the use of violence and that both sides are equally to blame” (MacDonald, A., 2021). Moreover, these terms are passive, removing agency from the conflict, which ultimately leads to “blame […] be spread evenly among those involved” (MacDonald, A.). The use of terms such as property or territorial disputes goes as far as removing the cultural and deep-rooted origins of the conflict, diminishing it to its legal core, e.g. the practice of Israel placing settlers in Palestinian territory and the dispute over this illegal practice. This, however, ignores the structural discrimination and continued harassment that Palestinians have to endure under the Israeli state (MacDonald, A.). Moreover, according to criticism, such terms suggest that these disputes are disputes over “contest grounds”, something that goes against UN decisions that these ‘contest territories’ are lawfully Palestinian territory (O'Toole, M.). Moreover, there is an alleged bias about what is reported and how reporting is followed up: much attention is given to Palestinian aggressors (“terrorists”), but little to Israeli violence (“police operations”) (O'Toole, M.)


This list of ‘neutral’ keywords is not exhaustive but offers an insight to the structure of the critics’ arguments. According to such criticism, the framing of the events of May 2021 appeared neutral, disguising the actual power structures at play, hence favouring the Israeli oppressor and legitimating its actions. Moreover, through distorted media coverage, western attention is disproportionally directed toward Palestinian violence against Israelis, while Israeli violence against Palestinians remains unseen. Overall, the framing of the May 2021 violence is alleged to be pro-Israeli in disguise, making it hard for uneducated readers to truly understand what is going on which contributes to the further marginalisation of Palestine. 

##Public spheres 

What can be observed here is that persistently voiced criticism of social media users, specifically Twitter users got institutionalised and expressed in the institutionalised framework of alternative media. Twitter (anecdotally: https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1391788220589936640), and the alternative media outlets can be understood as ‘public spheres’ where opposing views can be voiced (Kaiser et.al, 424). Through the network organisation of users who are aware of the violence committed in Israel and Palestine, it was possible to build up a thorough ‘response mechanism’ to every publication on Twitter, contradicting the established ‘neutral’ narrative. As posts regarding the conflict became more frequent, the average Twitter user the number of contradicting criticism rose accordingly - building up a united front against the common perspective on the conflict. As mentioned in Kaiser et.al.’s paper, research has shown that such united public spheres have the potential to influence politics and public discourse, as expressed by mainstream media outlets (ibid). Especially when supported by ‘alternative media outlets’ (general understood as media that expresses the view of (discourse) minorities) (ibid, 425) the discourse brought forward in the public sphere is able to challenge the narrative of mainstream media (ibid, 424).


#RESEARCH QUESTION AND METHODOLOGY
This research will exclusively focus on the framing of media attention to the conflict period, aiming to observe the impact of the issued criticism. The research will not look into the bias of reported events itself (e.g., whether Palestinian aggressors are more prominent in media coverage than Isralian aggressors) as it would go beyond the scope of text analysis research. Rather the research will look into the frames of media coverage; examining two aspects of the media coverage. 
Whether we can confirm the criticism’s observation of neutral framed coverage in favour of the Israelian narrative
Whether we can see a change in the frames as a reaction of such critique
With emphasis on the second question.
